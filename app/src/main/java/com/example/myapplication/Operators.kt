    Operator    Name            Description                         Example	Try it
       +	    Addition	    Adds together two values	        x + y
       -	    Subtraction	    Subtracts one value from another	x - y
       *	    Multiplication	Multiplies two values	            x * y
       /	    Division	    Divides one value from another	    x / y
       %	    Modulus	        Returns the division remainder	    x % y
       ++	    Increment	    Increases the value by 1	        ++x
       --	    Decrement	    Decreases the value by 1	        --x
